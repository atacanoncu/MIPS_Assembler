# Assembler

My take on the term project for my CNG 331 - Computer Organization course, written in python

The assembler has 2 modes;
1- Interactive Mode, where the instruction is provided from the command line
2- Batch Mode, where the source code is provided to the tool (gives an error at this moment, will be fixed soon)
